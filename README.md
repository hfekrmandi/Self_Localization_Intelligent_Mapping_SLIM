# Autonomous-GNC-MAS

If you do not have ROS installed, follow the tutorial here for Ubuntu 18.04: http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu (Note- install ros-melodic-desktop-full, as this code currently requires the gazebo simulator to function). Follow all steps on that page and then continue with this document. 
This code will not work with noetic or any future versions as of 5/11/2021, since ROS is deprecating TF prefixes, which means that multi-agent simulations are all but dead. 

Installing this code - 
Create a new ROS workspace for this code: \
... \
mkdir ~/simulation_ws \
cd ~/simulation_ws \
mkdir src \
catkin_make \
...

Then, cd into ~/simulation_ws/src/ and clone this github repo. Also clone 3 turtlebot ROS packages: \
... \
cd ~/simulation_ws/src \
git clone -b dev_inf_filter https://github.com/hfekrmandi/Self_Localization_Intelligent_Mapping_SLIM \
git clone -b melodic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3 \
git clone -b melodic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs \
git clone -b melodic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations \
cd .. \
catkin_make

sudo apt update \
sudo apt install python pip-python \
pip install scipy numpy opencv-python opencv-contrib-python \
...

Replace (USER) with your username (you can see it with echo $USER). \
... \
echo "source ~/simulation_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc \ 
source ~/.bashrc \
...

Your directories should look like:
- ~/simulation_ws
	- build
	- devel
		- setup.bash
	- src
		- Self_Localization_Intelligent_Mapping_SLIM
			- Autonomous-GNC-MAS
			- dse_msgs
			- dse_simulation
			- dse_simulation_gazebo
			- dse_simulation_python
			- dse_simulation_real
			- dse_turtlebot_descriptions
			- README.md
		- tureltbot3
		- turtlebot3_msgs
		- turtlebot3_simulations

I also highly recommend installing terminator. It allows you to easily run multiple terminals simultaneously.
With it open, you can use Ctrl-Shift-E to split a terminal horizontally, and Ctrl-Shift-O to split vertically. \
... \
sudo apt update \
sudo apt install terminator \
...

And for writing code, I recommend pycharm community. It can be installed through the ubuntu software center. Then, launch it from a terminal \
... \
pycharm-community \
... \
and open a project -> select the Self_Localization_Intelligent_Mapping_SLIM folder. Set up the interpreter to be your system's python3 executable, File -> Settings -> Project -> Python Interpereter -> (click on the gear on the right) -> Add... -> Existing Environment -> Add /usr/bin/python3. This will ensure that pycharm has your installed python libraries and all of the ROS libraries.  \

To test this code:  \
... \
roslaunch dse_simulation demo_1_agent.launch \
... \
This will start a gazebo simulation with a single agent and 3 tags lined up in front of it. Each of the 3 tags is seen and estimated by the agent. The estimates are visualized as a sample of 50 vectors from the mean and covariance of the estimate (Will be improved later to a covariance ellipse). \

... \
roslaunch dse_simulation 3_agents_moving_awayLine.launch \
... \
This will start a gazebo simulation with 3 agents facing 2 pairs of 2 tags. To start the agents moving, send a message to the controller of each agent. The consensus runs and combines the estimates of all agents. Rviz is set to display all objects as estimated by agent 0 (tb3_0).  \
... \
rostopic pub /control_on std_msgs/Bool "data: true" --once \
...

Visualizing in RVIZ
- Run the launch file dse_sim_3_robots.launch
	- This file runs the gazebo base_link true/estimate publisher node. 
	- In a terminal, source ~/simulation_ws/devel/setup.bash
	- Run the command roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_gazebo_rviz.launch
	- On the left side, under Displays -> Global Options, change the frame from odom to base_link
		- base_link is the robot's reference frame, so everything will be displayed in reference to it
	- Then in the bottom left click Add -> By Topic -> /dse/vis/[estimates or gazebo_true] whatever you want to look at. 
	- You can also go into each PoseArray and change the color so the pose arrows are individually identifiable
		- It's recommended to change the true pose to green

Node descriptions - 
- aruco_pose_estimation_node in aruco_pose_estimation.py
	- Inputs: Camera images
	- Outputs: Poses and IDs of all observed tags
	- What it does: uses the aruco library to find the pose of each tag, and publishes that pose in the robot's coordinate frame
- information_filter_node in information_filter.py
	- Inputs: Poses and IDs of all observed tags
	- Outputs: Information filter prior and measurement (Y_01, y_01, delta_I and delta_i)
	- What it does: Computes a step of the information filter
	- Reference information filter here
- direct_estimator_node in direct_estimator.py
	- Inputs: Information filter prior and measurement (Y_01, y_01, delta_I and delta_i)
	- Outputs: Information filter full estimate (Y_00 and y_00)
	- What it does: Adds the prior and measurement to create the result, and publishes that. Replaces the consensus since it isn't implemented yet. 
- dse_plotting_node in rqt_plot_output.py
	- Inputs: Poses and IDs of all information filter estimates, measurements, and true states
	- Outputs: Individual poses of all information filter estimates, measurements, and true states
	- What it does: Outputs a Pose for each estimate, measurement, and true state (rqt_plot won't seem to display PoseArrays)
- dse_visualization_node in visualize_pose
	- Inputs: Poses and IDs of all information filter estimates and measurements
	- Outputs: Poses of all information filter estimates and measurements
	- What it does: Outputs a PoseArray for all estimates and measurements (rviz can't display the custom pose array with an ID)


Debugging the code - 
- In Pycharm (or any debugging python IDE)
	- In a terminal, source ~/simulation_ws/devel/setup.bash
	- Then start the IDE from that terminal (Ensures that it knows about ROS libraries/messages
	- Ensure that you are using your python 3 interpreter (should be at /usr/bin/python3)
	- Degug any node file as you would a normal Python file. 
	- You can customize launch files to launch all other nodes, or start others individually through terminals
- In RVIZ
	- Make sure that the visualize_pose source file is running (publishes RVIZ-displayable messages)
	- In a terminal, source ~/simulation_ws/devel/setup.bash
	- Start RVIZ with the command rviz
	- On the left side, under Displays -> Global Options, type in odom as the Fixed Frame
	- Then in the bottom left click Add -> By Topic -> /dse/vis/[estimates, measurement, or true] whatever you want to look at. 
	- You can also go into each PoseArray and change the color so the pose arrows are individually identifiable
- in rqt_plot
	- Make sure that the rqt_plot_output.py source file is running (publishes rqt_plot-displayable messages)
	- In a terminal, source ~/simulation_ws/devel/setup.bash
	- Start rqt_plot with the command rqt_plot
	- Under topic, type in the topic name you want to see. 
	- /dse/plt/measurements/[position/[x, y, z], orientation/[x, y, z, w]] are the position and quaternion orientation of the measurement
	- /dse/plt/estimates/[robot, tag]/[position/[x, y, z], orientation/[x, y, z, w]] are the position and quaternion orientation estimates for the robot or tag
	- /dse/plt/true/[robot, tag]/[position/[x, y, z], orientation/[x, y, z, w]] are the position and quaternion orientation true values for the robot or tag
- By adding print statements
	- use print() normally in any node file
	- make sure that in the launch file for each node you have output="screen"

Other files - 
- src/dse_lib.py
